Tableau: Tripadvisor Hotel Analysis

➡️ View the Live, Interactive Dashboard on Tableau Public ⬅️

Project Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard created in Tableau to analyze traveler trends and hotel performance based on data from Tripadvisor. The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter by hotel name, traveler type, and rating to uncover insights into the guest experience.

This was a guided project that served as a foundation for mastering Tableau. I have added my own personal insights and key takeaways below.

Key Insights & Personal Takeaways

After building the dashboard, a few key insights became clear:

Insight 1: The "Business" traveler segment, while smaller in volume, consistently provides the highest ratings, suggesting a high level of satisfaction.

Insight 2: The "Friends" traveler segment has the most variation in ratings, often leaving the lowest scores. This would be a key area to investigate for service improvements.

Insight 3: The "Couples" segment, while rating highly, provided the most written comments, suggesting they are the most engaged and vocal group.

Technical Skills
Tableau: Created calculated fields, dynamic filters, and interactive dashboard actions.

Data Visualization: Built bar charts, tree maps, and text-based KPIs.

Data Analysis: Sliced and filtered data to identify trends and correlations.
